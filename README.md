# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project explores the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images — a foundational task in computer vision. Built in Python using TensorFlow/Keras, this project demonstrates how deep learning models can learn spatial hierarchies in image data.

## 🧠 Overview

In this notebook, I:

- Preprocess an image dataset
- Build a CNN architecture from scratch
- Train the model on labeled image data
- Evaluate its performance using accuracy and loss metrics

The goal is to understand how CNNs work under the hood and how they can be applied to real-world visual recognition tasks.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  
- CNN Layers (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense)

## 📁 File

- `ImplementCNN.ipynb`: Full notebook containing data loading, model implementation, training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Key Concepts

- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Overfitting and validation
- Deep learning evaluation metrics

## 🎯 Goal

To build an intuitive understanding of how CNNs classify images, and to lay the groundwork for more advanced computer vision applications.
